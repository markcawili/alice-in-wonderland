You play as Alice, finding herself stuck in the mysterious Wonderland. You must collect a
number of treasures and present them to a certain powerful character to be granted a way back
home and escape Wonderland.

There are multiple rooms, items, and characters to interact with within the world. There is also a chance to encounter
enemies that can end Alice's life in certain rooms. Alice can also find herself playing mini-games with certain
characters in the world to win important treasures.

You can initiate commands by typing in an action verb and then the name of the item or character
in question. Alice can "move" around with cardinal directions "north", "south", "east", and "west". Alice can
also "look around" her and at "look" items in her inventory. Alice can "take" items and "drop" them as well as
"talk" to characters she encounters. Alice can also check her inventory by typing "inventory", "inv",
or "i". When in an encounter with an enemy, Alice can "attack" to fight back or "run" to run away which
has a chance to succeed. Alice can replenish her health by taking bites of a cake that she finds to "eat" it. If
prompted for a minigame, Alice can say "yes" or "no" to start or avoid the game. The player can exit the game at any
time by typing "quit" or type "help" at any time to show this help menu again.

Invalid commands will be handled accordingly and a message will print out to you if an invalid command is entered
to which you can either try a different command or prompt the item or character again.
