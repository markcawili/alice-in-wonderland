some sunlight passing through. In the distance you see a bright green yard. You look another way and you see bright
colors emanating from a garden. Through a thick trail of bushes you see a sign that reads "The Duchess' Manor". On the
base of an old tree you see a tiny door, from it, you smell a sweet fragrance of baked goods. A Caterpillar catches
your attention as it puffs out a thick smoke from its mouth.
