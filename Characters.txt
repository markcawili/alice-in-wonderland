Oh I was late, late, late to my date! Now I can't even tell the time because I have lost my
pocketwatch! Oh, hello, what a surprise seeing you here. Did you follow me through the rabbit hole?
You shouldn't have done that! Now surely the Queen of Hearts will put you to work if you have any
hopes in leaving Wonderland. Say, I will give you this pearl necklace if you find my pocketwatch for me?
I must have dropped it when I went down the hole! Feel free to use my house to store your findings! Your
pockets are probably not as big as mine!

Be wary of the Queen of Hearts! She might not be as trustworthy as she seems...

Well what do we have here? Nobody ventures this far to visit The Duchess, you brave soul. You must
not be from Wonderland! Ha Ha Ha! I will help you poor girl if you play a game with me! Win this
game and I will give you the King's Staff! Surely it will be key in getting you home and out of
Wonderland. What do you say? Talk to me again if you want to play, Ha!

What are you still doing in my manor? Do you not have any manners?

*cough* *cough* Oh hello little miss. Have you gotten lost from where you came from? It is
dangerous to be in this here forest. What are you looking for? Who are you? *cough* *cough*
I suggest you leave, or you might get lost and not be able to return home! Or do you want to play
a game? I can give you this Hookah if you win! It is a wonderful treasure that might aid you in
appeasing the Queen of Hearts! *cough* *cough* Speak to me if you would like to play.

Tea Party

Mmmm what a splendid tea party! Hello! You there! Would you like a cup of tea? I am the Mad Hatter,
and I am the host of this tea party! You seem like you haven't had much to eat today, have a biscuit!
Oh, what a splendid day! Could be a lot better if I had my hat, but alas I have to settle for
this dinky old golden crown. Say girl, if you happen to find my hat, I will give you this crown!

Such a splendid day to have such a splendid tea party!

He He He, I am the March Hare! You best come to the tea party for some biscuits and tea! I notice you aren't from
Wonderland. I hope you find your way back, but I am afraid there is no way without talking to the
Queen of Hearts first. Anyway, I am on my way to the tea party if I can remember where it was! But wait, here is a
teacup!

Now where did The Mad Hatter say this tea party was?

Well, well, well if it isn't Alice, the little girl from the outside world! Usually I do not give
pity to outsiders who happen to stumble into Wonderland and ignore their common senses! But since
you're just little Alice, I will give you a chance! Bring me my crown back, my King's staff, and
six other treasures and I will send you back to where you came from! Leave it in the White Rabbit's
house and I will see to it once you come back with everything. Be careful out in Wonderland, it
is not as safe as you think it seems...
SEPARATE
You better keep looking for my crown and those treasures, or you will be stuck here forever! Ha!

Hello and welcome. I have noticed you accidentally got here through the rabbit hole. You curious
and reckless child. Oh, well. There is nothing you can do but talk to the Queen of Hearts and do
as you are told. I have heard she has lost her crown. It is with the Mad Hatter. Head to the tea
party, that is where you will find him. By the way, here is a pocketwatch I found. You might find
move useful than me.
SEPARATE
Have you talked to The Queen of Hearts? I am afraid doing what she asks is the only way out for you.
